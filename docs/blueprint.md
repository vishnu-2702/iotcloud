- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements like buttons and links, providing a contrasting and engaging visual cue.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface, well-suited for both headlines and body text.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent device types, statuses, and actions. Consistency in style across all icons to maintain a clean, unified look.

- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate state changes and data updates. For example, a smooth refresh animation when new data is received, or a subtle highlight on actionable elements when hovered over.
